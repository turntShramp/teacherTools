# Teaching Tools

This is a repo containing teaching tools that I use to teach JavaScript.

## Contents
* backToBasics - a folder concentrating on writing functions that return a portion of a large json object. 
* npmAndInquirer - a folder focussing on creating a CLI with inquirer and dividing the logic into different JS files.
* stackStarter - an exercise to help walk through teaching HTML, CSS and jQuery. 
* constructors - Pokemon as an example of JS constructors.
